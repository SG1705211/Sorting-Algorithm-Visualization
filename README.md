# Sorting Algorithm Visulization
This program allows used to visulize various sorting algorithms including merge sort, insertion sort and selection sort.
# Motivation.
I was deeply intrigued by the various videos on Algorithm visulization on Youtube when I learned the sorting algorithm, as they provides an intuitive way to understand those rather complex algorithms. \
Therefore, out of interest, and to improve my skills on Python, especially for graphics, I decide to write the sorting algorithm visulizations.
# Tools.
The program was built mainly using  **pygame** library.\
Other than the library, it used various features of OOP, the classes and instances in specific.\
The usage of classes and instances make the code more readable, as it provides an neat way to represent various information for certain button and shapes.
# Compilation.
Compile the `main.py`, then run the program.
# The program
It provides three types of sorting algorithms, and click on each of them will render an visulization for that specific algorithm.
